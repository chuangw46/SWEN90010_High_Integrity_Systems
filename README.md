#### AIMS

High integrity systems are systems that must be engineered to a high level of dependability, that is, a high level of safety, security, reliability and performance. In this subject students will explore the aims, principles, techniques and tools that are used to analyse, design and implement dependable systems.

#### INDICATIVE CONTENT

Topics include: an introduction to high-integrity systems; safety critical systems and safety engineering; mathematical modelling of systems; fault tolerant systems design; design by contract; static verification; and model-based testing.

Please check the [handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/swen90010) for more information about the subject.
